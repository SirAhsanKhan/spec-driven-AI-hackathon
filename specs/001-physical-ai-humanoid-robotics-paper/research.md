# Research & Decisions

This document records the key decisions made to resolve ambiguities in the technical context of the implementation plan.

## 1. Citation Management

- **Decision**: Zotero will be used as the primary citation management tool.
- **Rationale**: Zotero is a free, open-source, and mature tool with excellent browser integration for capturing sources, robust collaboration features, and the ability to generate bibliographies in many styles, including APA. This choice directly supports FR-010 (APA citations) and the need for a well-organized research process.
- **Alternatives considered**:
    - **Mendeley**: A strong alternative, but Zotero's open-source nature and more flexible data import/export make it a better long-term choice.
    - **Manual management**: Prone to error, inefficient, and would make adherence to APA formatting (SC-002) difficult to enforce.

## 2. Research Databases

- **Decision**: Research will primarily target the following databases:
    1.  **Google Scholar**: For broad discovery of academic papers.
    2.  **JSTOR**: For access to a wide range of peer-reviewed journals.
    3.  **Business school case study repositories**: Specifically, Harvard Business Review (HBR), INSEAD, and Wharton's public repositories for high-quality case studies mentioned in the spec's constraints.
    4.  **ProQuest**: For access to dissertations, theses, and additional academic journals.
- **Rationale**: This selection provides a strong foundation for meeting the requirement of 8-12 peer-reviewed sources (FR-005) and covers both theoretical and practical literature required for the paper's balanced focus.
- **Alternatives considered**:
    - **Scopus/Web of Science**: While excellent, they can have more restrictive access and are often redundant with the combination of Google Scholar and JSTOR for a paper of this scope.

## 3. Author Review and Feedback Process

- **Decision**: The review process will follow a simple, three-stage workflow:
    1.  **Initial Draft**: The primary author completes a full draft of the paper.
    2.  **Peer Review**: The draft is submitted to at least one other researcher or subject matter expert for feedback on clarity, argumentation, and evidence.
    3.  **Final Polish**: The primary author incorporates feedback and performs a final copy-editing and formatting pass before completion.
- **Rationale**: This structured process ensures quality control and incorporates external perspectives, strengthening the final paper. It addresses the implicit need for a review process in any academic writing project.
- **Alternatives considered**:
    - **No formal review**: Risks a lower-quality final product with unaddressed logical gaps or errors.
    - **Multi-stage, multi-reviewer process**: Overly complex for a paper of this scope and timeline.
